# About

Hi, I'm Lauren!

After working for 7+ years as an educator, I decided to make a career shift and learn to code.

I recently graduated from the Full Stack Web Development program at [CodeOp](https://codeop.tech/full-stack-development-bootcamp/) and am now looking to start my career as a developer.

Technologies I am familiar with include:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Node.js / Express
- MySQL
- Git

I am most interested in developing my skills on the **back end**, and am looking to add Ruby and Python to my skillset.

When not coding, I enjoy working on my French, reading novels, baking cookies, traveling to new places, and hanging with my cat, Nina.
